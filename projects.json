Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Kingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. Initially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution. Through the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world. Now there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!! Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog Add-Ons                  The Gambler's Chest Gambler's Rolls     First Hero Expansion In the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over. Kingdom Death: Monster Shipping Details & Shipping Waves One thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign. We have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020 . This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic. Rewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave. Like our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.) Backers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes. *Core Games Ships Separately! The Core Game is massive. To ensure its safety, it is being package into its own carton with corner protectors. It is too heavy to ship with other rewards. It would crush them!

Even I don't know for 100% what may happen during this campaign. Please note that the contents and prices of each wave are estimates and are subject to change depending on the final size of this campaign. Pledges finalized after the pledge manager deadline passes will ship from the United States and will incur additional shipping costs and potential delays. Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes. Risks and challenges I learned a lot about manufacturing a top-quality boutique game and fulfilling it to our backers from our first Kickstarter. Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets. I'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become. I will create a transparent, streamlined campaign from the outset and work hard to maintain the honest communication about our process and developments to make sure we meet everyone's expectations. We'll be pushing even harder to bring you the best of our vision without compromise. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game.  The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck. The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole. The game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman(The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel). We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you. So if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality. We think you'll love it as much as we do. Hugs and\nenchilada kisses, -Elan, Matt, and Shane. The Origin Story Exploding\nKittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was\ninserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the\njoker came up. It was called \u201cBomb\nSquad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all. Over the next\nfew weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game\nto life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to\njoin the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman\never asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.) We changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born. BUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY. We struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up. First, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs: But that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish. Next, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible. In the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution. Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on. From there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens. HELP US BUILD THIS GAME We wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community. We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better. So, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. With love and pork missiles, -The Exploding Kittens Team (Matt, Elan, and Shane) -------------------------------------------------------------------- For more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com Follow us: Facebook  Twitter Music: Royalty-free music from Bensound. Risks and challenges Production of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make. The biggest challenge for us would actually be if you blow us out of the water. We're already working with our pals at Cards Against Humanity to make sure that no matter how many people pledge, everyone gets their Exploding Kittens quickly after the campaign ends. None of us want this to be a campaign where you spend the next two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want to be sure you can start blowing up your friends as soon as possible. This is why (for now) we're not offering t-shirts or other complicated reward tiers that would make the distribution process take a lot longer. We're keeping it as simple as possible: support our project and in return we'll send you the playable game. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time! We love console games. There's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. But maybe people are missing out. We get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d  The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like. Deep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room. You busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV. It's time to upend console gaming. Let\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper! We're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe. OUYA: The revolution will be televised OUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android. We've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. Best of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try. Great games come from great developers. Developers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. That doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? OUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. And developers agree: \"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\"-- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower) \u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt) \"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas ( Madfinger Games ) \"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town) Design matters. We believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox). We are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development. We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it. Hackers welcome . Have at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us! Specifications: Tegra3 quad-core processor 1GB RAM 8GB of internal flash storage HDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD WiFi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth LE 4.0 USB 2.0 (one) Wireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad Android 4.0 ETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18) Standard OUYA Console Limited-Edition Kickstarter Console It's entertainment beyond gaming. Because OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. We've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.) All we need is you. With your help, we need to: Convert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them) Deliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch) Place our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!) Ideally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games) And if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! Show the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.

The 7th Continent is a cooperative game of adventure, exploration and survival, for 1 to 4 players, inspired by the adventure books where \u201dyou are the hero\u201c. It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created! The game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed . The Expansion \u201c What Goes Up, Must Come Down \u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover. In \u201c A Prison of Clouds \u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201c The Veins of the Earth \u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you. \u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d Tom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower \u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d Jamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games \"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming.  Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder.  The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\" Jeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple \u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game. Nothing else comes close to touching it in terms of its raw, epic scope, ambition and design.\u201d Richard Ham \u2013 Rahdo Runs Through \"I have over 50 hours of gameplay logged with 7th Continent and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. This is easily the best game of the year, and one of the best I have ever played in my life.\" Lance Myxter \u2013 Undead Viking Play solo or in a team of up to 4 players. 30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it! 1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game. Relive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood. No dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure! Almost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork. Join the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it. Live a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card. There are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not. An expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics! This expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions. It includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit. This new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes: 3 Storage trays 250+ cards 1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee) 1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee) 7 new Dividers 1 rule sheet The curse, \u201c A Prison of Clouds \u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent! Aboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026 You can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues. Take care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves. Make short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land. \u201c The Veins of the Earth \u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent. Aboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black. As insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse! \"Satchel & Journal\" Binder This new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal! 1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world. You are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons. Coincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise. You are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. \n \nWhen night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning... You start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.). Keelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards. \u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5). Your goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible. Do you have what it takes? A Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue. You are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board. Forests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location. To progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character , Skill , State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory. In order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force. Every action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed. Fight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed. Failing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force. Fall off this peak and you will likely get injured. Want to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last! Thankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success. A faithful companion and a precious item. The 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations. You will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses: Find or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them. Gather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back! Look carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations. There are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey! A page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.  You can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent! Edit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions. All the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign. How to add optional buys to my pledge? 1.\tClick on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page 2.\tOn the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button 3.\tThen, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the optional buy then click on the \u201cContinue\u201d green button 4.\tOn the window that appears, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d blue button. 5.\tIt\u2019s done! 6.\tA few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).   If you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys). What would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats? After 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. The cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible. However, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them. This campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure... This new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign. For those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018. Free Upgrade pack This pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign. NOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign) New Content If you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is: The expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent. Satchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card. All unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign. These items are included in the Veteran pledge. Also, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). The USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes. After our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project. The First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018 . The Second Wave, due in October 2018 , will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign. Shipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN , during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase.\nBelow, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay. During the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below). * You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated. **Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria. **Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic. **Europe (C) : Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate). Note: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN. Also, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate Would you like to pledge for multiple copies? Each copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3 , shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign). We\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil. Founded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life. Serious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America. The first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves! Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter Two friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist. Role-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!). We've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us. We are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production. Jamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson Jamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign. To our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent. To our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job! To Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures. To the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work. To all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality. To you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming! Thank you all! We wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent! Risks and challenges The re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. Work on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines. We will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. REFUNDS All pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. If the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.

JibbyVideos have done a spectacular job making this video showing what the Shenmue series is all about. If you were not around in 1999 when Shenmue first came out, or did not have the opportunity to play it if you were, you may have missed this game which has gone on to win the hearts of gamers everywhere, and influenced so many games to come after it. Making his way from Japan to China on a quest to avenge his father, Ryo Hazuki grows from boy to man, encountering new friends, and foes alike, as he completes his Kung-fu training. Tons of mini games were just one of the features that made the sandbox world of Shenmue so enjoyable. Shenmue defied all convention and created the genre that later came to be known as \"open world.\" An unparalleled level of freedom let you chose how you wanted to play. First of its kind realism, an immersive story, and not to mention, \nthe birth of the QTE\n, made Shenmue a one-of-a-kind experience and an instant classic. Shenmue 3 is the true sequel to the classic open world action RPG games, Shenmue and Shenmue 2. Created for modern platforms (PC and PlayStation 4) and built in Unreal 4, Shenmue 3 will continue the legacy of Shenmue. With your help, we can #SaveShenmue and rejoinRyo and our favorite characters on this new adventure! All images on the Kickstarter page are a work in progress. Shenmue 3 will have familiar elements from its predecessors and new fight mechanics to achieve a new level of interactive storytelling. If this project reaches its funding goal, Shenmue 3 will be available on the PS4 and PC. Our ambition is to deliver a Shenmue experience that will draw in newcomers to the series and reward diehard fans with its deep story and rich gameplay. 14 years of planning and ideas from one of the greatest game designers of all time\u2026 darn right, there are Stretch Goals! Could these Stretch Goals lead this next Shenmue to change the way we play games again? You know they can. But we can't add Stretch Goals after the game is on shelves. The more we can raise during this campaign, the more Shenmue 3 will come alive. Together, we can make it happen. Together, we can make a Shenmue that surpasses even the originals! Area Stretch Goal Explanation Where we left off...Ryo Hazuki has made his way to China in search of his father\u2019s killer. There he meets a new travelling companion, Shenhua, and learns of a legend from her village that has foretold their path together. The story continues as Ryo and Shenhua start off on a new journey that will take them farther into enemy territory, deeper into mystery, and ever closer to their destiny. Will the mystery of the mirrors be revealed? How is Ryo\u2019s father connected to all of this? Will Ryo track down the Chi You Men cartel and face Lan Di in a final showdown? Since the release of Shenmue 2, now 14 years ago, I have been greeted by the passionate outpouring of dedicated fans and Shenmue community members wherever I go. They all want to know one thing: \"When will Shenmue 3 be coming out?\" With the advent of games using Kickstarter during these past few years, the new and now frequent demand from the fans has been, \u201cDo a Kickstarter for Shenmue 3!\u201d If Shenmue 3 was going to get made, I wanted to make it with the fans. Through Kickstarter, I knew that could happen. Together, with Shenmue fans everywhere, I knew we could build the game that the series deserves. If we do not reach our funding goal, Shenmue 3 will not go forward. I know that the goal of making Shenmue 3 with the fans, and seeing Shenmue in the hands of gamers all around the world is a lofty one. We are balancing our ambitions for a grand sequel with the pragmatic realities of developing a game of this scale. It will not be easy, but I have dreamed of making this sequel for 14 years \u2013 it is time to bring Shenmue back! And to make it come true, it will need the love and support from each and every one of you! So please join us in making Shenmue 3 \u2013 let us grow our community and build a new, exciting Shenmue experience! Ryo - On a journey to avenge his father.

Excerpt from Budget Statement from Yu Suzuki Ys Net and I have been putting in many long years trying to find a way to bring back a sequel that so many fans have waited so long for. After learning of Kickstarter, I knew it would be possible to get Shenmue 3 started. Wanting to make the best game possible, I also knew that I would have to look to more traditional means to obtain all the funds that would be needed to create the game I had envisioned. I can say that with their assistance on the production and marketing end, and in Sony\u2019s case with some publishing support as well, Ys Net is able to use more of the money we collect through Kickstarter purely for Shenmue 3\u2019s development. It is also important to note that your funds are going strictly to Ys Net for development of Shenmue 3 \u2013 Sony and Shibuya Productions are not seeing a cent of your Kickstarter dollars. - Yu Suzuki Risks and challenges Risk and challenge are two words that have been with Shenmue 3 for the past 14 years. In fact, Shenmue has always been about risk and challenge. This time will be no different. The real challenge now is to deliver a sequel that we will all be satisfied with after 14 years of waiting. After much research and planning, we  set the funding goal at this level believing it will make possible a fulfilling Shenmue experience. With regards to development of the game, we have an experienced team, deeply connected with the Shenmue franchise. With modern tools, experienced professionals, and the community of Shenmue by our sides, we have set ourselves up for success. We will do our absolute best to deliver Shenmue 3 and the rewards by their respective deadlines. However, there is always the possibility that problems may arise which could affect reward delivery. There may end up being changes in game or reward designs. We may press right when we are supposed to press left and get hilariously head butted and kneed in the groin. In these situations, the whole Shenmue 3 team promises to keep you updated and informed on the game development and reward delivery progress. We are all very excited, ambitious, and optimistic that we have prepared well, and are ready for the challenges that are ahead of us. Ryo and Shenhua are not out of the woods yet, so we ask for your ongoing support. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art , it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends. Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems. Immersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!

Click!  The Chapters of Tainted Grail are built with replayability in mind and offer multiple branching paths, while the entire campaign has several alternative endings. After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience! And even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling. Your characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards. Regardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go! You will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep. The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting. Tainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story. In Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals. At Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world. We also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay. We are responsible for the following big titles: This War of Mine: The Board Game, The Edge: Dawnfall, Lords of Hellas, Nemesis. Risks and challenges We have currently successfully founded seven Kickstarter projects. We have successfully delivered so far: The Edge miniature universe, Awakening project, This War of Mine the boardgame, 1st Wave of Lords of Hellas, The Edge Dawnfall and are currently in the middle of delivering 1st Wave of Nemesis. We are confident about the delivery of the game and see no risk in that area - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Please note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product. Game and all components will be produced in China and will be up to the highest quality standards that we hold for our previous games.

Here\u2019s a recap of the big stuff: We launched and ended this historical campaign with live streams courtesy of twitch.tv . Check out the archived streams below: In addition to funding the creation of physical discs, the main purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund stretch goals, which will help IGA expand his vision for this game: Stretch goals are only the beginning. Unlock enough backer achievements by submitting fanart, making cool things, and joining us on social media, and you\u2019ll unlock Backer Inventory items that will change the campaign and trigger exclusive rewards.

Your name will be displayed under the clan of your choice! Miriam Picked up as an orphan by an Alchemist at a young age, she became a host for the dark Alchemists\u2019 curse. Although the magi-crystals were fused with her body at a young age, for 10 years she lay sleeping while the curse matured to its full form. It was during this period that the demons arrived, meaning that she missed their appearance and awoke with a mild form of amnesia, not quite fully understanding what happened to her. She is a woman of few words but strong of purpose. Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends. Gebel Original host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet. Gebel (JEE-bill) was the only one to survive its effects at such a high level. He destroyed the guild that created him, but in doing so realized he was no longer human and had no place on Earth. This in turn, lead him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet. It is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition. Johannes A member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel\u2019s best friend. Johannes (yo-HAH-nis)was the only Alchemist who dissented with the plan to call demons to the earth to cement Alchemy as the prevalent philosophy. His rejection of the other Alchemists\u2019 scheme is what kept him from sharing their fate. He has a vague understanding that Miriam\u2019s awakening and the demon castle\u2019s appearance are no mere coincidence. Exploration: Bloodstained's story unfolds as you explore Gebel's hellish castle; a sprawling structure that features a variety of locations. As you explore the massive castle you'll find warp gates that will allow you to travel quickly without having to backtrack too much. RPG Elements: It's not an Igavania without leveling, and Bloodstained will be no exception. In addition to the classic elements everyone\u2019s come to expect, enemies in Bloodstained will drop a wide variety of items, materials, and magi-crystals necessary to create the items that will get you safely through Gebel\u2019s castle. Crafting: As you explore, fight enemies, and complete quests you will gain experience and become more powerful, acquiring a variety of weapons along the way. Enemies will also drop materials you can use to craft new weapons and abilities using Miriam's training in alchemy. Risks and challenges Darkness lurks around every corner, seeking to corrupt all that it touches. The world is torn between those in power and those the powerful would destroy, and both sides are held in thrall by the demons lust and avarice. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be dishonest of us to promise you this one won't be. But Inti Creates has shipped more than 30 games on eight different platforms, and Koji Igarashi personally oversaw the production and design of one of Japan's most legendary franchises. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the kind of game they love to make, and they've got a lot of experience making them. Between us, the people behind this Kickstarter have helped to launch and fulfill several of the biggest, most complicated gaming Kickstarters ever launched. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it.) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for. IGA has worked for more than a year to prepare and gather support for this game because fans have asked him for it. Now that he's come to you for help, his goal is to make the game you've been waiting for. By backing this campaign, you'll become a part of the process. During and after the campaign he hopes to keep you involved, whether it's voting on swords and whips, telling us how you play his games\u2014as fast as possible, or exploring every hidden passage\u2014or helping us find the perfect style for the graphics. Finally, the possibility exists that a man scarred by unfeeling, power-mad alchemists could summon a hell-castle filled with demons across the street from Inti Creates headquarters in Tokyo. IGA has as much experience handling that risk as any game designer on earth, but we estimate that it might set production back slightly (depending on whether or not he's allowed to backdash).

Players choose from a number of core character classes and explore dangerous locations full of monsters, treasures, and deadly boss fights. Designed specifically for the Dark Souls\u2122 universe and introducing a number of innovative gameplay mechanics, with world-class miniatures faithful to the rich universe, this game delivers an experience that captures the very essence of the original video games. Click here forDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game 101 We don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There is just one pledge level for gamers, and one pledge for retail stores. As the campaign progresses, some stretch goals will unlock an \u2018Add-On\u2019 which is an optional item to purchase; to buy one of these, simply increase your pledge amount. This also drives the campaign total up thereby unlocking even more stuff! The best bit is that every ' non Add-On' stretch goal that gets unlocked during the campaign will be included in your pledge! So the more people that support the project, the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in, and the bigger the box we're going to need!

Click here to read the Reddit AMA with Mat & Rich Click here to read the fourth AMA with Richard Loxam Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is much more than a classic dungeon crawler. Just like the Dark Souls\u2122 video games, this is a game that requires strategic thinking, clever planning, and exemplary execution to succeed. Dragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough To triumph, players must explore dangerous locations, discover and defeat enemies, and collect equipment and treasures before ultimately facing the boss in an epic fight to the death. The Player Characters - Knight, Warrior, Herald & Assassin Playable in either Solo or Co-op modes, players choose their role from a number of core Dark Souls\u2122 character classes. Each class has a distinct role to play in the game, with a unique set of strengths and abilities. With multiple difficulty modes and a high-level of replayability, this is a game designed to be deep enough to satisfy hard-core tabletop gamers whilst remaining accessible to newer players. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game features an exciting \"fast setup, long reveal\" mechanic that gets you into the game faster and builds the location and encounters as you explore. With no fixed scenario layouts, it\u2019s as simple as choosing the direction to explore, placing a new tile down and flipping a card from the Encounter deck. Each time you decide where to go, you will experience a new danger as you explore, with each new location a real risk to your hard-won progress. If you die, then you drop everything you have collected and reappear at the nearest bonfire. So do you return to the bonfire to rest and spend Souls to strengthen up, but in doing so fully reset the locations?Or do you press on and pray that the next encounter isn\u2019t beyond your capabilities? After all, the next location may contain a clue to the Boss and how to defeat them\u2026 Combat is both fast and deadly. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game rewards clever players and punishes \u2018button mashing\u2019. Players must learn enemy behaviors in order to fight more effectively, with classic fighting game style combat windows. The Titanite Demon mini-boss The game features a \u201cdynamic positioning system\u201d which makes combat fluid and ever-changing. With the game state constantly shifting as combatants move around the battlefield, players must stay alert to danger and opportunities. Equipment, armour,  and weapons are discovered or earned during play, but with limited slots players must think carefully about what is best to keep and use. Using a simple stamina management system, players can potentially leave themselves exhausted and vulnerable. Death is usually swift to follow a poor decision in combat. The Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss accompanied by a group of Hollow Using our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working with one of the finest board game manufacturers in the world, the quality and detail in the miniatures is world-class. With the entirety of the Dark Souls\u2122 universe available to use, one of the hardest decisions has been to narrow down which enemies and bosses to include in the core game. The Gargoyle mini-boss The Core Game contains: 3 Boss Models 5 Mini-Boss Models 4 Player Character Models 4 Large Grunt Models 12 Grunt Models 7 Double Sided Game Tiles 2 Double Sided Mini-Boss/Boss Tiles 4 Player Character Boards 3 Boss Dials for Tracking Damage 60 Equipment Cards 40 Treasure Cards 26 Boss AI Cards 36 Encounter Cards 15 Coloured Dice 100+ Game Tokens Prepare to Die... Check out the prototype Boss Fight versus the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and people's reactions to it... Add-Ons will unlock as the campaign progresses. To purchase these Add-Ons simply increase your pledge amount by the amount stated. After the Kickstarter campaign ends you will then be able to select your options via our pledge management system. The Mega Boss Expansions (+\u00a328) are additional purchases you can make to enhance your board game experience. These models are big - the Gaping Dragon is around 12-15cm tall! They also come with additional items to support their gameplay: A Tileset for the Mega Boss Encounter (vary in quantity dependent on the boss) 1 Boss Dial for tracking damage A Unique Mega Boss AI Deck that fully replicates their movements and attacks within the actual game itself Specific Mega Boss Treasure Cards The Gaping Dragon Black Dragon Kalameet The Guardian Dragon The Four Kings (4 Models Included) The Darkroot Basin Expansion (+\u00a335) brings some iconic characters to the game including Sif, the Great Grey Wolf. This expansion comes with: 2 Boss Models (Sif & Artorias) 7 Large Grunt Models 7 Grunt Models 2 Boss Dials New Treasure Cards New Encounter Cards Boss AI Decks for Sif and Artorias If you want to explore some new locations within the universe then the Darkroot Basin/Iron Keep Gaming Tiles Add-On (+\u00a315) is for you! These double sided tiles will feature artwork from the Darkroot Basin and Iron Keep environments from the game and will allow backers more options of exploration during their game play sessions. Please NOTE that they are NOT required in order to use the Darkroot Basin/Iron Keep Expansions. You can also purchase multiple Souls Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a380 per pledge. NOTE: There is no Early Bird discount on these additional pledges. The 'Extra Souls Pledge' gets you a second copy of the Core Game with Applicable Stretch Goals. \"A lot of the minutia is even the same, like bosses changing attack patterns midway through battle (which is true of Dark Souls 3 at any rate), and you heal up using carefully managed Estus Flasks. Positioning plays an important role in these battles as each attack is limited to a certain selection of nearby nodes.\" - Eurogamer \"it looks like a very cool board game, with excellent miniatures, that may very well scratch the Dark Souls tabletop itch so many of us have had for so long now.\" - Forbes \"Steamforged Games' official tabletop game based on Dark Souls will adopt the series' notorious level of difficulty, according to the board game maker.\" - Polygon \"We really want to play that Dark Souls board game\" - Destructiod \"Steamforged has had experience with Kickstarter in the past. The tabletop maker held a campaign for its medieval football game, Guild Ball. The campaign was successful; it exceeded its \u00a330,000 ($42,352.50) goal, raising a total of \u00a393,691 ($132,268.27).\" - Gamespot \"Dark Souls is an exceptionally good video game series, but can it work as a board game? It looks like we'll have the opportunity to find out soon, because board game company Steamforged Games is planning to make one, with the blessing of Dark Souls publisher Bandai Namco.\" - PCGamer \"The attention to detail is astounding, and the figures might be worth it on their own\" - Kotaku \"if you're looking for even more Souls in your life, you're in luck.\" - Game Informer \"this is certainly something to watch out for.\" - Tech Times \"If you're a fan of Dark Souls, and you want to share the experience with your friends outside the game, an upcoming Kickstarter may be of interest to you.\" - The Escapist \"If you haven't had enough ways to die in Dark Souls games, then you may want to consider getting your virtual wallet ready to support an upcoming tabletop endeavor for the franchise.\" - Shack News As the Campaign progresses, we will unlock a number of stretch goals that will be added to your SOULS PLEDGE for Kickstarter backers for FREE! We know the challenges retail faces with Kickstarter projects.  This project is our first step towards changing this for the retailers. Steamforged Games Ltd are determined to support retail at every level. With our previous project - Guild Ball, wecommitted that after the project had launched all further products within the range would be direct to retail. We kept that promise. With Dark Souls\u2122 - we go one step further and are building support directly into the Kickstarter itself. The Retailer Pledge level contains 6 copies Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game along with a number of other benefits: Retailer Bonus Unlocks - We have built into the Kickstarter several additional retailer bonus unlocks that once unlocked (via the number of retail backers in the campaign) will provide 'Add-On' purchases available onlyat retail and not purchasable during the Kickstarter by backers. These will not be limited runs but a general release available to all customers upon launch of the game in shops. Current Bonus Unlock Items Exclusive Timed Access - You will be the first stores to receive the Core Game and the only stores to have 4 weeks early access to the launch day products and retailer exclusive stretch goal products upon release. Exclusive Point of Sale Items - Along with your retail stock, we will send exclusive point of sale items as a thank you for supporting us from the start. To help retailers guarantee their initial stock, you may purchase additional Retailer Pledges by increasing the pledge amount. We will be supporting localisation options for the game and have confirmed the following languages currently: English French Spanish German Italian We are also considering other localisation options depending on demand during and after the Kickstarter campaign ends. You will be able to choose the language of your version via the pledge manager system. Shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. We will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers) USA (US backers) Canada (Canadian backers) Germany (EU backers) China (Asia Pacific backers) Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) Below are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates - costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and add-on purchases you choose. UNITED KINGDOM: \u00a37 USA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to most states. \u00a322 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. CANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. EUROPE: \u00a37 to Germany. \u00a310-\u00a322 to most other countries. \u00a325 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \u00a330 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Serbia. \u00a340 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \u00a343 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \u00a350 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. LATIN AMERICA: \u00a335-\u00a343 to most countries. ASIA: \u00a37 to China and Hong Kong. \u00a322 to most other countries (no estimate available for Malaysia). OCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia. \u00a322 to New Zealand. AFRICA: \u00a350 to most countries. Any pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline window will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs. Below is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan - again these are estimates: Kickstarter Campaign Ends 0 Day - Pledges are charged. 1 Week - Survey sent confirming emails. 1-2 Months - Pledge Manager sent to backers confirming add-on purchases, extras and taking payment for shipping. 1 Month Before Shipping - Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. Shipping Starts 0 Day - China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight. 2-5 Weeks - China sends EU/AUS/US hub orders prepacked by sea freight. Asian hub orders begin packing and shipping. 6-8 Weeks - UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping 9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks. 13+ Weeks - UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders. Late confirmation orders and customer service requests for missing/broken items dealt with via support@steamforged.com After the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will be using the BackerKit software for our Pledge Management System.

We will, however, ensure a global release of any 'Retailer Stretch Goals' and future Dark Souls\u2122 products for retailers. We have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter, however we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all. ======= Refunds ======= Refunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending including fees. After this time refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees due to us not being able to claim them back after 60 days. If we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6-8 weeks before the actual shipping date) we are unable to refund at this stage. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 60 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only. This is a GBP Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in GBP for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day at which the refund is processed as detailed above. ================= Terms and Conditions ================= If you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm it will be treated as abandoned. We will however look at each case sympathetically and try our best to satisfy each customer. By pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your order as entered into the pledge management system. You are responsible for import or other duties that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. You also accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit. We are unable to ship to PO Boxes. If you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release.

Players control a party of medieval fantasy survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of zombie orcs controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them! Here's everything that's been added to the basic Horde pledge: And here's everything you can add if you want: Click the links to find out more about Friends and Foes , No Rest for the Wicked , Paul Bonner box , Adrian Smith box , Ultimate Survivors , Extra Tiles Pack , Rat King & Swamp Troll , 3D Plastic Obstacles , 3D Plastic Hedges , Massive Darkness Crossover , Fatty Bursters , and the Classic Optional Buys: Deadeye Walkers, 3D Doors, and Plastic Token Pack . Zombicide: Green Horde expands upon the fantasy universe introduced by Zombicide: Black Plague . A new group of Survivors of different species will bring their unique expertise to the fight against the undead armies threatening to crush the kingdom. Green Horde's survivors: Rolf, Megan, Asim, Berin, Johannes, and Seli. As they explore the ravaged villages, Survivors gather all manner of equipment to aid them in their quest. From swords, hammers, bows, and armor, to magic scrolls and flasks of dragon bile! All of that equipment is neatly displayed in each Survivor's plastic dashboard, with appropriate slots for each type of card, as well as trackers for wounds, skills, and experience. Berin's Dashboard with a full inventory. Some of the equipment in Green Horde have a special synergy with other equipment. For example, carrying a Norse Sword is certainly not bad at all. However, it will become a lot more effective, rolling 2 extra dice, if you also manage to equip a Norse Shield on your other hand! The highly detailed Green Horde survivor miniatures. The Survivors will need to be well prepared to deal with the new menace they'll face: Orc Zombies! When the black plague hit the orc tribes, it spread like wildfire, creating a swarm of undead brutes. Orc zombies are stronger than their human counterparts, being able to tear apart the most resilient of Survivors. An attack from an Orc Walker deals 2 wounds, while the attack of an Orc Fatty or Abomination deals a whopping 3 wounds! The little Goblin Runners only deal 1 Wound per attack, but they are fast and numerous, so don't judge them by their size. And finally, while the Orc Necromancer is not very deadly in itself, you'll want to eliminate it quickly, as its powers bring even more Orc Zombies onto the board. The Green Horde: Orc Walker, Goblin Runner, Orc Fatty, Orc Necromancer and Orc Abomination.  As lethal as the Orc Zombies are, probably the scariest thing about them is their ability to launch surprise attacks by unleashing an overwhelming horde against the Survivors. Every time an Orc Zombie spawn card is drawn, one extra zombie of the indicated type is added to a \"Horde area\" outside the board. As the game progresses, players will watch with dread as the looming threat of the horde grows in number, just out of sight. When an \"Enter the Horde!\" card is drawn, all miniatures in the Horde area are placed in the spawning Zone. The situation just got a lot more dire! The imposing Orc Zombie miniatures. To give them a fighting chance against the green horde, the Survivors have gotten their hands on a mighty trebuchet! This ingenious catapult can hurl all manner of payloads across great distances, striking powerful blows against the undead invaders. This siege engine is extremely difficult to operate, requiring 3 actions to either push it to the next zone, or to fire it against the enemy. However, the Trebuchet can fire at any zone in the game (and even against the looming Horde), with no regard to distance or line of sight. Survivors can also choose among 3 types of ammunition to use, from a scattershot that can decimate a swarm of Walkers, to a boulder that can kill an Abomination if aimed right! The powerful Trebuchet makes for an amazing miniature. Zombicide: Green Horde expands the action into the outskirts of the kingdom, where the villages blend with picturesque crops and hedges. The crops have withered in the abandoned villages, and some streets are flooded with the irrigation water, but these features create new challenges and opportunities for Survivors. Waterhole zones slow down the Survivors (and douse Dragon Fire), but some of their edges are steep ledges that Zombies are unable to climb out of, forcing them to make a detour while you run for safety. Hedges block line of sight, but not movement, allowing Survivors to play a dangerous game of hide and seek with the Zombies (however, you never know what might be waiting on the other side of a hedge). Waterholes and Hedges on the new tiles. Zombicide: Green Horde comes with: 9 double-sided game tiles 72 miniatures 6 survivor plastic dashboards, color bases, and ID Cards 48 plastic trackers 6 dice 133 cards 68 tokens 1 Rulebook Preview Rulebook: Please be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements. We invited Rodney Smith, from Watch It Played, to try out Zombicide: Green Horde , and give you all a brief overview of its rules as he plays through a bit of the game. Horde Pledge For $120, the Horde Level pledge gets you: Zombicide: Green Horde core box (SRP $100) + the Kickstarter Exclusive Feral Dragon pack (ERP $30) + All Applicable Stretch Goals. Note that anything marked with this: is an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. Dragon Bile had to come from somewhere, right? The Feral Dragon is a Kickstarter Exclusive expansion that all backers will receive. It adds a massive foe which will shake your game experience to its foundation! Spawned similarly to an Abomination, the Feral Dragon enters the game by stomping the central Zone of its tile, reducing any building there to a pile of rubble, and scattering or killing any being unfortunate enough to be there. Towering above everything else, the Feral Dragon sees all, showering the nearby Zone with the most Survivors with its deadly dragon breath, or flying to the next adjacent tile to further smash the village and chase its prey. Bringing down the Feral Dragon will certainly not be easy. Each time it lands it features a vulnerability to only a specific weapon type, and damaging it only makes it fly away, waiting to dive into the village again when a new Spawn card is drawn. Only once all of its 8 Vulnerability cards have been used, the Feral Dragon is finally eliminated for good from the game (its Spawn cards now bringing some respite to Survivors). Scale comparison between the Feral Dragon and Asim, the Survivor. To help Survivors in their quest to bring down the Feral Dragon, this pack comes with a new Siege Engine: a Ballista, including its awesome miniature. Lighter than the Trebuchet, the Ballista can be moved or fired by spending only 2 actions. The Ballista's piercing bolt is able to target several Zones in a straight line, wiping out loads of enemies. 3D render of the Ballista. Find out more about the Friends and Foes expansion HERE .

CLASSIC OPTIONAL BUYS: If you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on the Zombicide: Green Horde Kickstarter page and in the pledge manager add the amount of the items you'd like to get. We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.    Please Take Note! Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. USA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico CANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. LATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. ASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). OCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries. EUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. Unfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them. *WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Be aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us. Please note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. The table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances. To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE . Risks and challenges This is our 27th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: Production delays Shipping delays Customs delays The estimated delivery date is June 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and Rum & Bones: Second Tide. We have three ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is about to begin the shipping process, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch and Rising Sun which are in production. Please refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Green Horde. REFUND POLICY We can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees. All refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. TERMS AND CONDITIONS By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.

The Base Game Pledge for the core boxes gives you a complete game experience with dozens of stretch goal extras for even more replay value. However, the Batman universe is so vast that we couldn\u2019t fit all of it into the core boxes. The expansions listed below all add new miniatures, new gameplay, new game boards, new scenarios, or a mix of all of these. They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content. Here is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price: If you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager. Click on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack  The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios. Click on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex! Click on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers. Click on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion  Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there. To represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn. This expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side , boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode. This expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion . The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains. Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system . Each game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes , who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives. The heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game Each game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game. The game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get. But this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.

At the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster. Each hero is represented on the game board by a blue miniature. From left to right: Nightwing, The Huntress and Robin From left to right: Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Batman and Catwoman Batman sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron The Huntress sculpted by Edgar Skomorovski Each hero has their own hero board detailing their characteristics, skills, and traits. Batman, Jim Gordon, and Nightwing's hero screens The hero board is made of 2 parts: a hero screen that slides into a bat-tablet. A hero screen and a bat-tablet forming a hero board This hero board allows the player to control their hero to perform actions such as fighting or jumping from a walkway , by spending energy cubes from their reserve zone. These energy cubes represent both a hero's life points and their capacity to act. The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become. But when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds. The double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones To better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment: A hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills. Equipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm) Finally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt. Bat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm) A hero setup Facing the heroes is one player: the villain. They alone command their multiple troops represented on the game board by grey miniatures.

A Brutes Chains tile with the 4 miniatures it controls The villain controls their characters through a plastic dashboard called the command board , in which punchboards and the tiles are placed.

They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count. Plastic sample of the command board Close-up of the plastic sample of the command board To better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment: All miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted. SCALE The scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows usto create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint. But some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex! From left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya THE BASES As you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base. A 3D render of the five 30mm bases OUR EXPERIENCE This is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords). As you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic. This experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.

You\u2019ll be able to choose the language of your game during the Pledge Manager phase, after the campaign. Tous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface. We will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface. For a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license. To be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only! We talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this . And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company. Based on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world).

Thisnew board game, designed by Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, is the result of a collaboration between Awaken Realms (creators of This War of Mine: TBG, The Edge: Dawnfall and Lords of Hellas) and Rebel (creators of Drako, Dream Home and K2) . It's a 1-5 players semi-cooperative Sci-Fi horror where you and your friends try to survive while attempting to fulfill your secret objectives that may sometimes collide. It will also enable full co-op as well as solo play experience. Nemesis offers one-of-a-kind gameplay, that you currently won't find anywhere else in the board game world.It has been in professional development for over three years, so it already plays very well, provides good balance and contains a multitude of interesting mechanics, as proven by the prototype reviews below. If you like Sci-Fi survival settings and ships swarming with alien life forms, you will love it - and if that genre was never on your radar, this game is likely to change your mind! By backing this project on Kickstarter you will get all unlocked Stretch Goals for free to every Core Box!  Click to see details about sundrop  *Out of all reviews / movies two were paid: Cardboard Rhino(rules presentation / tutorial how to play that took a lot of time to make!) and Man vs Meeple (which is a preview showing the game in detail). All other videos were not paid. Asymmetriccrew members  During the game, you will control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. Soldier on the other hand... Your characters complement each other and will need to collaborate in order to survive. There's one catch: you are never sure who can you trust! Cinematic experience You drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm! Fighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is\u2026 plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You\u2019re not alone! Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of Sci-Fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A hacker breaks into ship\u2019s navigational system and enables self-destruction. A pilot sets the alien nest on fire, while his friend seals himself in the control room. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. All this \u2013 and other memorable actions \u2013 await! Ship exploration One of most important parts of Nemesis gameplay is exploration. Every room of the ship may contain useful items and enables a different special action, from activating fire extinguishers to cutting out infected tissue. This makes it necessary to reveal as many room tiles as possible. But beware, while searching for a proper room, you will make noise that may draw some uninvited guests. Ship's layout is randomized before each game, so you are never sure what to expect behind next corner... Unique combat This game is more about surviving than killing. When you face horrors from outer space, you may panic, and even if you manage to put up a fight, you will never know how much punishment your opponent can take. Killing intruders is a tough challenge, especially since ammunition is a rare commodity on the ship. Evolving Intruders Jerry, big news! We\u2019ve received the first transmission with some preliminary data. It seems it\u2019s an\nauxotrophic, anaerobic, mineral-based trans-dimensional life form (what a mouthful). No DNA, XNA or\nanything else we could expect. Instead, a strange self-propagating crystalline structure. Outer skin layer?\nPure Lonsdaleite! We've never seen more than few grains on Earth, and this thing is covered in it! Fifty\npercent tougher than diamond, go figure. It sheds this outer skin during each development cycle, thanks to a violent thermochemical reaction. But\nthat's not the worst part. You've heard about this research into weird crystals with a structure partially\nhidden in other dimensions? Well, our guys say these creatures employ a similar process. Much of their\ngrowth happens... elsewhere. Then, when they gather enough energy, they shift modified organs and body\nstructures back into this world. The may also be native to deep space, as they survive vacuum well enough\nto put Tardigrades to shame. Anne also believes they\u2019re an extremely adaptable omnivore. Sounds scary,\nright? I hope the top knows what they\u2019re doing with this one. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. Time pressure Encroaching enemies are not the only thing that pushes you to work faster. The ship is already counting down to the emergency hyper-jump. If you fail to repair the engines before that happens, or if the jump catches you outside of your stasis pod, extreme acceleration is going to turn your character into a red splatter on one of the walls. World and design We've reached for the stars. Asteroid mining was booming. Colonies on Mars and Venus approached self-sufficiency. Then, a wanderer came from far depths of the universe at half the speed of light. It glanced the Earth's moon, ripped it apart, threw out of its orbit, and caused catastrophic damage below. Solar system plunged into crisis. Still, many chose to focus on profit, as the residue from the impact contained unknown minerals and exotic matter that made our plain old asteroids seem boring. Obsolete spaceships, previously used for colonizing the solar system, were refitted and crewed by people desperate enough to spend years in vast spaces between the stars, hunting for the next big catch. They became whalers of deep black, scavenging for comets, asteroids, dead proto-planets, and other strange objects coming from far corners of the universe. Click to see full Intruder design Many disappeared. It was to be expected. Intercepting unknown objects at incredible speeds was not exactly safe. Then, there are rumors at least one crew found something they were not supposed to... Risks and challenges We have currently successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects. While the Nemesis campaign goes live, we're in the middle of shipping the first wave of Lords of Hellas game. Soon after the end of this campaign, we estimate to start the shipping of The Edge: Dawnfall, which was delayed. These two projects at this stage are managed production and delivery team, while Nemesis is on creative stage, so they do not collide. We are confident about the delivery of the game - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Even though the bulk of design work is already completed, as proven by many reviews, Nemesis is a huge and complicated title, and in pursuit of great quality it might take more time to complete. Please note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. Here's a look at everything included in a base pledge: And all the Optional Buys you can get: Click to learn more about Dynasty Invasion , Playmat Board , Art Book , and Metal Coins . Created by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage , with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey. Choose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle. Each of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies. Koi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable. Koi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi. Dragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next. Dragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi. Bonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally. Bonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi. Lotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray. Lotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi. Turtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces. Turtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi. Played over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided. The Political Mandates. During the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side. When players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits. Komainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite. Oni of Skulls and Oni of Souls. Oni of Hate and Oni of Blood. River Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure). The miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic. Alliances are formed. Alliances are broken. At the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances. Do not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale. The Kami await the worshippers. When players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play. Each Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war. When Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! Game Components: 58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters. 40 Counter Bases 137 Tokens 5 Clan Screens 5 Political Sheets 53 Cards 6-fold Gameboard 1 Rulebook You can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE . For $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock! The Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. The Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan. Note that anything marked with this: is an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only.

If you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on the Rising Sun Kickstarter page and in the pledge manager add the amount of the items you'd like to get. We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.   Please Take Note! Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight) . Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. USA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. CANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. LATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. ASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). OCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries. EUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $70 to Greece and Turkey. Unfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them. *WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Be aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us. Please note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. The table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.

Risks and challenges This is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: Production delays Shipping delays Customs delays The estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide. We have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production. Please refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun. REFUND POLICY We can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees. All refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. TERMS AND CONDITIONS By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.  For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.
